leap motion(sensor control)snake game
This is an arduino-python based project which lets you play the old snake game without actually taking inputs from keyboard but by movement of your hand in front of ultrasonic sensors.

I have used HCSRO4 ultrasonic senosrs,arduino UNO,python IDLE(2.7.8),pyserial library,Vpython library and curses library
